This project aims to build a system for translating Moroccan Arabic (Darija) into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We will address the challenge of improving translation accuracy by reviewing existing data, augmenting it with additional human-annotated and synthetic data, and finally training a translation model. The projectâ€™s success will be measured by the achieved BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score on a held-out test set.
